# Catan Randomizer

This is an in-progress hobby project to produce randomized [Catan](catan.com) boards under constraints, e.g. `6` and `8` cannot touch, or three hexes of the same terrain type cannot be clustered. It is currently deployed [here](https://catan-randomizer.vercel.app/). More to come...
